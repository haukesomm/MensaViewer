## Mensa Viewer (Flutter)

MensaViewer (Flutter Edition) is a Flutter app inspired 
by fredericobormann's original 
[MensaViewer](https://github.com/fredericobormann/MensaViewer), compatible with 
Android, iOS and soon the web.  
It is built on the newest stuff around Flutter and Dart and features some
cool additions over the original, including:

- [ ] Cross-platform availability
- [X] An overhauled design
- [X] Easy navigation between more than three Mensas at a time
- [X] Indicator whether regular or staff prices are displayed
- [ ] Offline Caching
- [X] All the latest Flutter-Goodness :P

_Note: Some of the above named features are WIP and marked with an unchecked 
box._
